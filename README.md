Description

Balancing delicately between charmingly old-fashioned and seemingly outdated, “The Count of Monte Cristo” navigates through these nuances.

The dataset, initially assembled for sentiment analysis, includes movie reviews that provide a rich basis for examining public sentiment. Originally collected by Pang and Lee, this corpus was further enhanced by Socher et al., who added detailed sentiment labels to each phrase using crowd-sourced annotations. This analysis challenge involves categorizing phrases into five distinct sentiment classes: negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, and positive. The complexity of accurately classifying these sentiments is heightened by linguistic elements such as negation, sarcasm, terseness, and ambiguity, making this task particularly challenging.
